Thrilled to share that I recently implemented a full-scale DevOps lifecycle at Abode Software, streamlining their product development and delivery process. The implementation included Ansible for configuration management, Jenkins for CI/CD, Docker for containerization, and GitHub for source control. Excited about the impact this has had on improving efficiency and reducing deployment time! Looking forward to sharing more details. Feel free to connect or ask questions!
